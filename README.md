# ZMB2 Project
There 'll be two scripts (both written in Perl):
1-Linux compatible (mostly cross-platform)
2-Windows compatible (more features like key logging)

=Intro:
ZMB = Zombie, so it is going to be a simple IRC-based botnet script that provides below features:
	.Simple shell commands runner
	.Simple Perl code runner (eval)
	.Run simple IRC commands for a better access to the bot
	.File uploader with link shortener
	.Simple key logging *Just for Windows
	.Background changer (for victim to freak out :v) *Just for Windows

I once did this and it was awfully-coded so I thought it would be better to remake it.

=Documentation is available in "HELP.txt"

=Outro:
At the end I would like to thank you that you took a look at this and (probably) going to tell going to tell me my mistakes.

As this was one of my first projects I really need your help for getting improved.

END <3
