# ZMB2 Project
There 'll be two scripts: 1-Linux compatible (mostly cross-platform) 2-Windows compatible (more features like key logging)

Intro:
ZMB = Zombie, so it is going to be a simple IRC-based botnet script that provides below features:
	-Simple shell commands runner
	-Simple Perl code runner (via sub {})
	-Run simple IRC commands for a better access to the bot
	-File uploader with link shortener
	-Simple key logging *Just for Windows
	-Background changer (for victim to freak out :v) *Just for Windows

I once did this and it was awfully-coded so I thought it would be better to remake it.

Also this is written for Windows but some features would probably work on Linux, too. In that case you may want to take a look at "zmb2bot_linux.pl".

Outro:
At the end I would like to thank you that you took a look at this and (probably) going to tell going to tell me my mistakes.

As this was one of my first projects I really need your help for getting improved.

Bye <3
